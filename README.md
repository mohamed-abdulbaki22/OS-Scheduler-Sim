# OS-Scheduler-Sim
A scheduler is created to manage resources among processes. An interpreter is implemented to execute program files, and a memory module is developed to store processes. Mutual exclusion over resources is to be managed using mutexes, and a multilevel feedback model scheduling algorithm is to be utilized.
